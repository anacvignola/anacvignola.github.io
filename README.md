My website: https://anacvignola.dev/, I created this repository to share my knowledge, and learn more and more. At the moment I've only used HTML and CSS, but I plan to constantly update it with new technologies, to make it a responsive site.

I started using Bootstrap, but I'm still exploring. https://getbootstrap.com/

I'm using the icons from this library: http://fontawesome.io/

As in my page I use background image, I leave here some sites that I search for high quality images to use.
